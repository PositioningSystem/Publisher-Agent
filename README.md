# Publisher Agent

The publisher agent is responsible for organizing the positioning data (raw data) received from a Synthetic Data Generator (see CSV-Data-Sender
project) for a given identifier (e.g., tag) and sending it to the edge via AMQP or MQTT messaging technologies.

>**Note:** At this moment the project is ad-hoc to send positioning data loaded in CSV, but in the To Do is to give guidelines to send any kind of data.

## Project status

- The project is under development: ðŸ›  by [sfl0r3nz05](sfigueroa@ceit.es)

## Architecture

- The publisher agent must be ready for use in any environment. E.g.:

## Requirements

- In order to establish a connection with the rest of the components, they will have to be in the same docker network as the publisher. The requirements are to have docker installed and a network called `syntheticnet` created on it, to install docker you can follow [this](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) guide, and to create a docker network run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker network create syntheticnet
  ```

- In case of using the agent to connect to an already existing network, it will be enough to modify the docker-compose file. E.g.:

  ```console
  networks:
    default:
        external:
           name: syntheticnet
  ```

## How to Receive any kind of data from SDG

## How to use

1. Set the environment variables of the `docker-compose.yml` file depending on the messaging technology:

    > *Note: PROTOCOL environmental variable allows to define the messaging technology type*

    ```bash
    PROTOCOL=AMQP
    ```

    > *Note: TOPIC environmental variable defines the name of the topic to be used*

    ```bash
    TOPIC=/5jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov/tag001/attrs
    ```

    ```bash
    AMQP_QUEUE_HOST=rmq0
    ```

    ```bash
    MQTT_QUEUE_HOST=mosquitto
    ```

2. Comment on the DataSender library depending on the messaging technology:

    ```bash
    nano ~/publisher_agent/src/DataReceiver.js
    ```

    - If use MQTT to comment the next line:

    ```bash
    import { connect, sendMessage } from './DataSenderAMQP.js'
    ```

    - If use AMQP to comment the next line:

    ```bash
    import { connect, sendMessage } from './DataSenderMQTT.js'
    ```

3. To launch the program using docker simply place your terminal in the project folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

## Test the publisher agent for amqp

For test purpose adding the next service to `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
rmq0:
  hostname: rmq0
  image:  'rabbitmq:3.6.7-management'
  ports:
    - 5672:5672
    - 15672:15672
  cap_add:
    - ALL
```

   ### Demonstration

   - [Demonstration video of sending data from the SDG to an AMQP publisher agent](https://youtu.be/OavGNGMnQZ4)

## Test the publisher agent for mqtt

For test purpose adding the next service to `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
mosquitto:
  image: eclipse-mosquitto:1.6.14
  hostname: mosquitto
  expose:
    - "1883"
    - "9001"
  ports:
    - "1883:1883"
    - "9001:9001"
  volumes:
    - ./mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
```

## To Do

- Add trivy vulnerability scanner to github workflow
- Improve project documentation
- Manage any kind of data
- Support other the messaging technologies like Kafka or HTTP
- Implement a solution to handle several topics simultaneously
